        "instruction": "What was the impact of the climate-smart maize initiative?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "The initiative benefited smallholder farmers, maize consumers, and seed markets. It also served as a blueprint for CGIAR\u2019s 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The DTMA project ran for 10 years and involved CIMMYT, IITA, and national, regional, and private sector partners in sub-Saharan Africa. It released 160 affordable climate-adaptive maize varieties and was recognized as one of CGIAR\u2019s 50 standout innovations."

        "instruction": "Why is maize important in sub-Saharan Africa?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Maize accounts for almost one-third of the region\u2019s caloric intake, is grown on over 38 million hectares under rainfed conditions, and faces climate challenges such as drought, which affects 40% of cultivated areas and leads to 50% crop losses in severe cases."

    {
        "instruction": "What are the benefits of drought-tolerant maize?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Drought-tolerant maize stabilizes production under dry conditions. Farmers using it produced over a half ton more maize per hectare in dry years, supporting a family of six for nine months. It has strengthened seed markets, benefitted 8.6 million farmers, and lifted millions above the poverty line."

        "instruction": "What additional traits are included in climate-adaptive maize?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Climate-adaptive maize varieties are developed to tolerate multiple climate-driven stresses and are biofortified with nutrients such as provitamin A and zinc to improve nutritional outcomes."

    {
        "instruction": "What is the future strategy for climate-smart maize innovation?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "The future strategy involves CGIAR\u2019s strategic orientation to empower research for development initiatives and formulate comprehensive responses to climate change. CIMMYT and IITA emphasize a multisectoral approach to address global climate challenges."
