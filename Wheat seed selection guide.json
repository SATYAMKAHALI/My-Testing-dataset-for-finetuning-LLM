        "instruction": "What are the characteristics of spring wheat?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Spring wheat is planted in the spring and thrives in warmer temperatures. It has a shorter growing season and is less tolerant to frost, making it ideal for regions with mild winters."

        "instruction": "How does temperature affect wheat growth?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Winter wheat requires temperatures below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) for vernalization and thrives in spring temperatures of 55\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (13\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Spring wheat prefers temperatures between 60\u00b0F and 80\u00b0F (16\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C) but is more sensitive to frost and extreme cold."

        "instruction": "What are the precipitation requirements for wheat varieties?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Winter wheat needs consistent moisture for root establishment and additional water in spring for head development. Spring wheat requires sufficient moisture during planting and early growth, with regular precipitation being crucial for a successful harvest."

    {
        "instruction": "What soil conditions are ideal for wheat cultivation?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Winter wheat excels in loamy or clay loam soils with good drainage, whereas spring wheat is adaptable to various soil types but prefers loamy soils with good organic matter and drainage."

    {
        "instruction": "What is the preferred soil pH for wheat?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Winter wheat prefers a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0, and acidic soils may need lime treatment. Spring wheat flourishes in soils with pH between 6.0 and 7.0, and regular soil testing is recommended."

    {
        "instruction": "What diseases and pests is spring wheat resistant to?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Spring wheat is resistant to wheat streak mosaic virus and tan spot. It also has pest resistance, reducing the need for chemical interventions."
