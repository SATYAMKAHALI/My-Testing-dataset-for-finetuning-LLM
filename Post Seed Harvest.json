        "input": "",

        "output": "Elevated air temperatures and clear, cloudless days before or during seed harvest can lead to heat damage. For example, at an air temperature of 32\u00b0C, perennial ryegrass at harvest had a seed temperature of 41\u00b0C."

        "instruction": "What strategies can help mitigate seed heat damage?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "If 'hot' seeds are not cooled quickly before storage or processing, storage fungi can proliferate, further heating the seed lot and degrading quality. Shading seeds from direct sunlight during drying can help prevent excessive heat damage, especially in countries where sun drying is practiced."

        "instruction": "How does temperature affect relative humidity in seed storage?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In temperate environments, the water-holding capacity of air is temperature-dependent, causing relative humidity (RH) to decrease as temperature increases."
