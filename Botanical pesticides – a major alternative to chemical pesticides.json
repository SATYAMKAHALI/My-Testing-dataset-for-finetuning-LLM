Governments and regulatory agencies are supporting the adoption of biopesticides by implementing policies promoting their use. With growing consumer demand for organic produce and reduced pesticide residues, botanical pesticides are expected to play a vital role in the future of integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable agriculture."
