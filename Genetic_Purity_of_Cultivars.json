        "output": "A critically important impact of climate change on seed production involves the potential loss of genetic quality in open-pollinated and F1 hybrid cultivars. Elevated CO2 and temperature can induce changes in plant sexuality, leading to a breakdown in self-incompatibility or male sterility mechanisms. These breeding systems are essential for promoting outcrossing in open-pollinated crops and ensuring F1 hybrid seed production. Breakdown of these mechanisms results in self-pollination, leading to genetic contamination and loss of cultivar integrity."
