        "instruction": "What factors influence seed germination under elevated CO2 and temperature?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Seed germination responses to elevated CO2 vary by species. A higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio can reduce seed protein content, limiting amino acid availability for embryo growth and reducing viability. High temperature stress before physiological maturity can impair assimilate supply, causing reduced germination and seed viability."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Seed systems play a crucial role in helping farmers adapt to climate change. In developed countries, commercial seed companies provide access to climate-resilient cultivars through structured seed certification processes. However, in developing countries, where formal seed systems are weak, farmers rely on informal sources such as saved seeds and local markets. This limits access to improved seed varieties designed to withstand climate stresses."
    },
    {
        "instruction": "How do formal seed systems differ from informal seed systems?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Formal seed systems are highly structured, involving commercial seed companies, government regulations, and seed certification to ensure genetic purity and performance. Farmers in these systems have access to newly released, climate-adapted cultivars. Informal seed systems, on the other hand, rely on farmer-saved seeds, local markets, and community exchanges. These systems dominate in developing countries, where commercial seed production is limited."

        "instruction": "What is the impact of commercial seed companies on climate adaptation?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Commercial seed companies play a key role in climate adaptation by developing and distributing high-yield, stress-tolerant crop varieties. They ensure genetic purity through certification programs and enable farmers to access improved seeds that can withstand drought, heat, and pests. However, high seed costs and limited distribution networks can be barriers for smallholder farmers in developing regions."
